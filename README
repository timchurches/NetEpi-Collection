CHANGES TO THIS AND PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF NetEpi Collection
==========================================================

A summary of changes made in each new version appears in the CHANGES file.
An exhaustive list of the changes made since the inception of the project
appears in the CHANGELOG document in doc/ directory contained in this
distribution.

A NOTE FOR THOSE WISHING TO UPGRADE EARLIER VERSIONS OF NetEpi Collection
=========================================================================

Users of very early versions of NetEpi Collection - that is, versions released
prior to May 2005 (Version 0.90) - should consult the developers via email
for advice on how to proceed with upgrading existing installations.

Users of Version 0.90 or later should carefully read the advice provided
below (especially the INSTALLATION section). If in doubt, please do not
hesitate to contact the developers via the netepi-discuss mailing list
(see below) for advice on upgrading.

DOCUMENTATION AND MANUALS
=========================

End-user and administrator manuals for NetEpi Collection v1.6 are still
being updated to reflect new features and changes made since v0.90 was
released. These updated documents will be available before the end of April
2010 from the same Google Code and SourceForge sites from which the NetEpi
distribution tarballs and the manuals for v0.90 are available. Some interim
documentation of the wiki mark-up feature, which was introduced in Version
0.94, appears in the doc directory of the distribution.


BUG REPORTS, FEATURE REQUESTS AND GENERAL DISCUSSION
====================================================

Please report all bugs, problems, feature requests and ideas to the
NetEpi-discuss mailing list. You need to subscribe to this list in
order to post messages to it - see the list management Web page at:

    http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/netepi-discuss


PREREQUISITES FOR USERS
=======================

Any recent Web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 6 or later,
Mozilla or Firefox Version 3.0 or later, Opera Version 9.0 or later, all
versions of Safari, all versions of Google Chrome), and a TCP/IP network
connection (Internet, intranet, VPN, LAN, localhost, etc) to an instance
of NetEpi Collection installed on a suitable Web server.

Note that there is a known minor problem when Internet Explorer v5.0 is used
to access NetEpi: if the "Intercept browser BACK button" feature is
set to ON in the Tools | Preferences page (it is on by default), then
clicking the browser back button results in a blank page. Clicking the 
browser reload button fixes the problem. In the Safari browser, 
if the "Intercept browser BACK button" feature is set to ON, then 
the browser back button is effectively disabled. If it is set to OFF
or if Javascript is disabled in the Safari, Konqueror and Opera browsers,
use of the browser back button may result in unexpected behaviour, which 
can be avoided by simply using the "<<Back" buttons provided in the NetEpi
application itself.

In summary, with default settings, the browser back button behaves in an
intuitive manner when using the NetEpi application in all web browsers
except Safari. In Safari, the browser back button is effectively disabled
and users need to use the "<<Back" navigation buttons provided in the
application itself (which is preferable anyway).


NOTES FOR APPLE MAC OS X USERS
==============================

Please see the accompanying README.mac file for some notes specific to 
installation on Apple Mac OS X computers.


PREREQUISITES FOR SERVER INSTALLATION
=====================================

0)  A recent Linux, Unix or Apple OS X server (either a dedicated server,
    which is preferred, or a workstation acting as a server). At this time,
    running the application under Microsoft Windows is NOT supported.

1)  Apache 2.x Web server or an equivalent HTTP server (needs to be able
    to run CGI). The web server needs to be secured in the usual fashion
    if it is to be accessible via the Internet.

2)  Python 2.4 or later. If using Python 2.4, then version 2.4.1
    or later is required because earlier versions of Python 2.4 have
    a defect in their regular expression library (bug #1088891), which
    adversely effects Albatross web template parsing.

    If possible, you should use the python packaged with your server
    platform (Python comes pre-installed in RedHat, Fedora Core, Debian,
    Ubuntu and Mac OS).  
    
    Alternatively, you can download the Python source and build that:

    Python can be obtained from:

        http://www.python.org/ 

    If you prefer, you can compiled Python from source:

        1) Unpack the Python tar archive (.tgz file) 

        2) As root in the top level directory created by the tar archive: 

            ./configure 

        3) make 

        4) make test 

        5) make install 

        6) check that the python executable is in the default path

3)  Albatross 1.35 or later (Web application framework for Python)

    NOTE: If using Python 2.6, Albatross 1.40 or later is required.

    Albatross may be downloaded from:

        http://www.object-craft.com.au/projects/albatross/ 

        1) Unpack the Albatross tar archive 

        2) As root in the top level directory created by the tar archive: 

            python setup.py install 

        3) The Albatross session server needs to be started in the
           security context of a non-privileged user (not root or
           nobody!) - typically you want to start it automatically from
           an init script which contains a line such as:

            su -s /bin/sh foo -c "\
                /usr/local/bin/al-session-daemon \
                    --pidfile=/home/foo/al-session-daemon.pid \
                    --log=/home/foo/al-session-daemon.log \
                    start > /dev/null 2>&1" < /dev/null

           where "foo" is the name of the user context in which the
           session server daemon will run.

4)  eGenix mx tools (specifically mx.DateTime)

    If you are using RedHat or Fedora Core, install the "mx" package via:

        sudo yum install mx

    If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, install "python-egenix-mxdatetime" via:

        sudo apt-get install python-egenix-mxdatetime

    Alternatively, download and install from source:

        http://www.egenix.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html 

        1) Unpack the tar archive 

        2) As root in the top level directory created by the tar archive: 

            python setup.py install

5)  PostgreSQL, minimum 8.1.x, 8.3 or later recommended. We strongly recommend
    the use of and/or upgrading to the latest available point release
    (as designated by the third digit in the version number) for a given
    release version (as designated by the first two version number digits)
    of PostgreSQL, as later point releases contain important security fixes.

    If your operating system vendor supports PostgreSQL, we recommend using
    their packages (using yum or apt-get). Make sure that you install packages
    for the PostgreSQL server, the PostgreSQL client libraries and the
    PostgreSQL developer libraries (the latter are needed to install pyPgSQL
    or ocpgdb - see below).  Alternatively, PostgreSQL may be downloaded from:

        http://www.postgresql.org/

        Compile PostgreSQL with defaults. 

        Make sure your PostgreSQL installation has a "root" user that can
        create new databases and users (issue the command "createuser -a
        -d root" if needed).

        You will probably also need to edit the PostgreSQL pg_hba.conf 
	configuration file to allow the user in whose context the web 
	server (httpd) runs access to the database. For Debian-based systems,
	something like this may need to be added:
	
	    local all www-data sameuser;
	   
	Or for Red Hat/Fedora Core-based systems:

	    local all apache sameuser;
	

6)  A Python-to-PostgreSQL interface module:

 EITHER pyPgSQL Version 2.5.1 or later

    pyPgSQL may be downloaded from:

        http://sourceforge.net/projects/pypgsql/

        1) Unpack the tar archive 

        2) Change into the directory created by the tar archive

        3) As root install the package:

            python setup.py install

 OR ocpgdb

    ocpgdb may be downloaded from:

        http://code.google.com/p/ocpgdb/downloads/list

        1) Unpack the tar archive

        2) Change into the directory created by the tar archive

        3) As root install the package:

            python setup.py install

 (Disclaimer: Andrew McNamara, the principal NetEpi developer, wrote
  the ocpgdb adaptor module, and naturally we think it is the better
  of the two adaptor modules listed above.)

7) [optional but strongly recommended] FastCGI

    NetEpi Collection can be deployed using mod_fastcgi for Apache. This
    provides a very significant improvement in the responsiveness of
    the application and is recommended for high-volume installations
    or those with many users. However, FastCGI can be a bit tricky to
    install (although should not be too hard for most sysadmins).

    Detailed instructions for compiling and installing mod_fastcgi
    (FastCGI) are beyond the scope of this document - please see the
    FastCGI Web site at http://www.fastcgi.com for details.

    Once installed, you will need to add some directives to your Apache
    configuration file. The following are EXAMPLES ONLY of directives,
    in this case for Apache2 on Fedora Core Linux - you may need slightly
    different directives for your version of Apache on your server -
    consult the FastCGI and/or Apache documentation.

    # Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support 
    LoadModule fastcgi_module modules/mod_fastcgi.so

    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/collection/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/collection/"

    # AddModule mod_fastcgi.c
    <IfModule mod_fastcgi.c>
        # is this the best option?
        FastCgiIpcDir /tmp 
        FastCgiConfig -idle-timeout 300
        <Directory /var/www/cgi-bin/collection>
            AddHandler fastcgi-script .py
            Options +ExecCGI
        </Directory>
    </IfModule>

    Finally, if you run Collection under FastCGI, remember that you need to
    stop and then restart Apache if you upgrade the Collection application or
    HTML templates. FastCGI also maintains persistent database connections
    (one of the reasons it is so much faster than plain CGI), so you
    will need to stop Apache if you wish to upgrade your database etc.

8)  [optional] MatPlotLib v0.90.x or later

    MatPlotLib may be downloaded from:
       
        http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net

    Note that MatPlotLib has several dependencies, and for recent Linux
    distributions, by far the easiest way to install it is to use a package,
    which will (or should) automatically resolve the dependencies and install
    any additional libraries required.  If you choose to build and install
    MatPlotLib yourself from source please read the MatPlotLib installation
    notes carefully to ensure that its dependencies on various third-party
    libraries have been met first (this is likely to include the "dev"
    or "devel" versions of the cairo, freetype, pango, libpng and zlib
    libraries).
    
    Debian and Ubuntu users can install matplotlib via:

        sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

    RedHat/CentOS/Fedora Core users can find RPM packages for matplotlib
    and its dependencies via RPMFind:

        http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=python-matplotlib

    NetEpi Collection will still function perfectly well if you do not
    install MatPlotLib on your web server, however the epi curve graphs
    will not be available.

9)  [optional] Graphviz - Graph Visualization Software

    GraphViz source may be downloaded from:

        http://www.graphviz.org/

    For Debian and Ubuntu systems, install via:

        sudo apt-get install graphviz

    RedHat/CentOS/Fedora Core, you will probably need to use the graphviz,
    graphviz-gd, gtkglext-libs and gts packages from here:

        http://www.graphviz.org/Download_linux_rhel.php

    NetEpi Collection will still function if you do not install GraphViz
    on your web server, however the case-contact relationship visualisation
    report graphs will not be available.

10)  [very optional]  Selenium Core 0.8.0 or later

        A work-in-progress Selenium end-to-end test suite is also
        included. The Selenium tests are useful for verifying the 
        correct operation of a NetEpi Collection installation, 
        although their main purpose is to act as a set of regression 
        tests for NetEpi Collection developers.

        Please see the README file in the Selenium tests directory for 
        further information.

        To run these tests, you will need the Selenium Core web testing
        framework, available from:

        http://www.openqa.org/selenium/

        1) Unpack the Selenium distribution, and recursively copy the
           "selenium" sub-directory to your web server document directory
           (typically /var/www or /var/www/html).

        2) Copy the contents of the Collection "Selenium" directory to the
           "tests" sub-directory of the selenium directory on your
           web server.

        3) Point your browser at http://webserver/selenium/TestRunner.html,
           where "webserver" is the name of your web server.

        4) Select a test suite, then run the selected test.

        The tests assume a fresh, default Collection installation with a
        newly initialised database, and with admin user password sn00Py
        (double zero, not oh oh).

        ***NOTE: please remember to reset the admin password after
                 you have finished testing!

        The Selenium web testing framework is written in Javascript and
        runs within your browser. Most modern browsers will work: IE,
        Firefox and Safari on all supported platforms. Opera doesn't
        appear to work at this time.

        We strongly recommend that you remove the selenium directory
        from any production Web server after testing is complete,
        as it is unknown whether Selenium presents any security holes
        (probably not, but Selenium is a complex piece of code and is
        still itself a work-in-progress).

11)  [highly optional] ClientForm & ClientCookie

    A load testing framework is also included, however the tests are currently
    broken due to a comprehensive redesign of the application interface.  It is
    included in this distribution as a placeholder, and will be updated in a
    future release. Please see the README in the load directory for further
    information. A contribution of fixed or extended load tests is welcome.

    This framework requires:

        ClientForm

            http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientForm/

            1) Unpack the tar archive

            2) As root in the top level directory created by the tar archive: 

                python setup.py install

        ClientCookie

            http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientCookie/

            1) Unpack the tar archive

            2) As root in the top level directory created by the tar archive: 

                python setup.py install

12) [completely optional] Documentation diagrams are prepared with Dia (0.97):

        http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia/

        (only needed if you wish to modify the diagrams)

13) [entirely optional] Icons, logos and "image" buttons are prepared with 
    The GIMP:

        http://www.gimp.org/

        (only needed if you wish to modify logos and icons).



INSTALLATION of NetEpi Collection
=================================

    Make sure your PostgreSQL installation has a "root" user that can
    create new databases and users (use "createuser root" if needed).

    To perform a default NetEpi install, simply run "make" in the top
    level directory as root. The install scripts know default paths and
    web user names for:

        RedHat Enterprise Linux/Fedora Core Linux
        Debian Linux (and most derivatives)
        Apple OS X

    Additional platforms can be added by editing simpleinst/platform.py
    (If you add entries for other platforms, please let us know so we can
     include support for those platforms in future releases.)

    The installer will ask for an initial password for the "admin"
    user. You can change this password from the admin web interface,
    but this initial password will be required to log in to the admin
    application.

    A number of parameters can be configured at install time. You can
    either edit the Makefile and change the "COLLECTION_CONFIG" option,
    or pass them on the command line:

        make COLLECTION_CONFIG="\
            appname=foo \
            dsn='::foo:' \
            registration_notify='nobody@example.com' \
            exception_notify='nobody@example.com'"

    After installation, configuration parameters can be changed by
    editing the "config.py" file in the "collection" cgi-bin directory.

    Configurable parameters include:

        appname (default: "collection")
            Application name - effects install paths, cookies, etc. The
            application name must be a valid file name, and must not
            contain path components (path separators or drive letters).

        apptitle (default: "NetEpi Collection")
            User visible application name

        cache_form_summaries (default: False)
            If True, form summaries are only generated when a form is
            updated. If False, they are generated on demand (which requires
            loading the form definition and form instances for each summary
            generated). The main drawback of caching summaries is dates are
            formatted according to the editing user style preferences, rather
            than the viewing user's style preference (which can be particularly
            confusing when one uses date style DMY and the other uses MDY).

        cgi_dir (default is platform dependent)
            Application scripts and data will be placed into a sub-directory
            "appname" off this directory.  Default depends on operating
            system, but is typically something like /usr/lib/cgi-bin or
            /var/www/cgi-bin.

        compile_py (default: True)
            If True, the installer will byte-compile all python code after
            installing it.

        contact_label (default: Association)
            Controls the presentation name of associations between cases
            (formerly "contacts"). Note that the application makes a
            plural form of the label by appending an 's'.

        create_db (default: True)
            If True, the installer will run the database conditioning tool
            - if the database already exists, the scheme is upgraded if
            necessary. If the database does not exist, it is created.

        debug (default: False)
            If True, enables the display of diagnostic information at
            the foot of the application page.

        date_style (default: DMY)
            Determines the default date style (for input and output)
            for an instance, although it can still be overridden by
            individual users. "DMY" means "DD/MM/YYYY" format, "MDY"
            means "MM/DD/YYYY" format and "ISO" means "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

        dsn (default: "::collection:")
            Data Source Name - describes database host, port, database
            name, database user and database password. Currently database
            passwords are not supported - this will change once we have
            audited where the DSN is exposed.

        dup_per_syndrome (default: False)
            If set to True, person (duplicate) searching is restricted
            to the current syndrome, if False, persons associated with
            any syndrome will be returned.

        enable_matplotlib (default: False)
            If matplotlib is available, setting this to True will
            enable additional visualisations (only report epi curve at
            this time).

        exception_notify (no default - no e-mail notifications)
            Application exceptions will be e-mailed to this address,
            if set.  Multiple addresses can be listed, comma separated.

        form_rollforward (default: True)
            If False, existing forms remain associated with the version
            of form they were created under.

            If True, the form editor attempts to upgrade data collected
            by older versions of the form when a new version of the form
            is deployed. This can fail if the new schema is incompatible
            with the old (this prevents form deployment, but does not
            alter the form data).

        group_label (default: Context)
            Controls the presentation labelling of the "group" entity.

        helpdesk_contact (default: "the NetEpi Helpdesk")
            Contains a description of the body responsible for supporting
            the application. Used in the context "please contact ...". 
            The string can contain HTML elements (for example, a URL or
            e-mail link).

        html_dir (default is platform dependent)
            Fixed application content (images, help text, style sheets)
            will be installed in an "appname" sub-directory of this
            directory.

        immediate_create (default: True)
            If True, cases are created when the user clicks the "Create"
            button on the search result pages.

            If False, the user must explicitly create the case from
            the case page. This allows the user to review all personal
            details prior to creating the record, rather than just the
            summary information shown in the search results.

        install_debug (default: False)
            Enables debugging output from the installer

        install_logo
        install_logo_small
            If set, these specify paths to alternate application logos that
            will be installed with the application. The first is the login page
            logo, the second is the logo that appears in every page banner.

        install_verbose (default: False)
            Enables verbose output from the installer

        login_helpdesk_contact (default: "the NetEpi Helpdesk")
            Similar to helpdesk_contact, but shown in less secure contexts
            (login and new user registration) where the disclosure of internal
            address and phone numbers could be problematic. Contains
            a description of the body responsible for supporting the
            application. Used in the context "please contact ...".  The string
            can contain HTML elements (for example, a URL or e-mail link).

        max_requests (default: 1000)
            If non-zero, after servicing this many requests, we exit gracefully
            to minimise the impact of memory fragmentation and object leaks
            (only relevant for persistent application servers).

        nobble_back_button (default: True)
            When True, this enables a mechanism that exploits side-effects
            of the <iframe> tag to intercept the browser <back> button and
            thus reduce the change of the browser and application getting
            out of sync.

        notification_host (default: local)
        notification_port (default: 13535)
            The optional notification daemon makes certain data changes
            propagate between application server instances faster. Application
            processes send the notification daemon messages to announce
            that a certain object has changed, and all interested clients
            then receive a copy of this notification, and discard any cached
            copies of the referenced object.

            notification_host can be set to "none", "local", or an ip address
            or host name. When set to "none", no notification daemon will be
            started and time-based cache expiry is used. If set to "local", a
            daemon local to this instance will be automatically started if one
            is not already running, with communications occurring over unix
            domain sockets.  If set to a hostname or ip address, application
            processes will attempt to connect to that address and no local
            daemon will be started (use the stand-alone daemon on the server
            host).
        
            When the notification daemon is not local, notification_port sets
            the port number to use.

            NOTE - the notification daemon protocol is currently
            unauthenticated - anyone who can connect to the port can generate
            spurious notification messages, or kill the daemon. By default,
            the daemon only accepts connections from the local machine. In
            environments with untrusted users, the notification daemon should
            not be used at this time (set port to a null string: '').

            NOTE - you must have ONE notification daemon per NetEpi
            Collection INSTANCE.

        order_syndromes_by (syndrome_id DESC)
            An SQL "order by" clause used for sorting the presentation
            of syndromes. Recommended columns are "syndrome_id"
            (essentially the order in which the syndromes were added),
            "name" or "post_date". This must be a valid column name from
            the syndrome_types table. "DESC" can be appended to reverse
            the sort order.

        person_label (default: Person)
            Controls the presentation labelling of the "person" entity.

        registration_notify (no default - no e-mail notifications)
            New user registrations and locked-account notifications will
            be e-mailed to this address, if set. Multiple addresses can
            be listed, comma separated.

        session_secret (default: random)
            This string is mixed with any session data that makes a
            round trip via the user's browser to prevent unauthorised
            modifications being made. The string must be kept secret,
            and should not be shared with other applications.

        session_server (default: "localhost:34343")
            If set, contains the host and port of the Albatross session
            server. Server-side sessions will be used. Consult the
            Albatross documentation for more information on the session
            server.

            If not set, hidden-field sessions are used - session data
            will be saved in hidden form fields, and protected from
            alteration by a cryptographic hash (but are NOT encrypted).

        session_timeout (default: 1200)
            When using server-side sessions, sessions will expire after
            this many seconds (both the session server data, and the
            browser cookie are based on this setting).

        show_all_syndromes (default: False)
            If True, show all syndromes on main page, not just those the
            user has access to.
            
        subbanner (default: "Network-enabled tools for epidemiology 
                             and public health practice.")
            Typically rendered in a smaller font under the apptitle on login
            and page banner screens.

        syndrome_label (default: "Case Definition")
            Controls the presentation name of "syndromes". Typical values
            are "Case Definition", "Syndrome", or "Outbreak ID".

        tabbed_demogfields_threshold (default: 0)
            When many demographic fields are enabled, the screen can become
            quite cluttered. If the count of enabled fields exceeds the
            this threshold, the application switches to a tabbed rendering
            of the demographic fields, where fields are grouped together by
            function, and the groups then rendered inside tabs. To disable
            the tabbed rendering, set to 999.

        tracedb (default: False)
            If set to True, application SQL queries will be written to
            the web server error log. This is primarily a developer tool.

        unit_label (default: Role)
            Controls the presentation labelling of the "unit" entity.

        user_browser (default: True)
            If True, allow users to view details of other users of the
            system (subject to that user's privacy settings).

        user_check_interval (default: 30 days)
            User details check interval in days - if the user has not updated
            their details in this time, remind them to review them. Set it
            to 0 to disable this check.

        user_registration_mode (default: 'register')
            New user registration mode. Choices are:

            none        Users can only be added by admins.

            register    A button on the login page invites the user to
                        register their details. After registering, their
                        details are reviewed by an admin prior to their account
                        being enabled.

            invite      An existing user invites a prospective user onto the
                        system via a one-time URL that takes the prospective
                        user to a registration screen.  After registering,
                        their details are reviewed by an admin prior to their
                        account being enabled.

            sponsor     An existing user sponsors a prospective user onto the
                        system via a one-time URL that takes the prospective
                        user to a registration screen. After registering, the
                        sponsoring user verifies the identity of the new user
                        and then enables their access.

        web_user (default is platform dependent)
            User name to install files as - this should match the user
            id your web server runs CGI scripts as.

    The installation process creates a minimally populated database. After
    installation, the web admin interface should be used to create
    additional units, users and groups of units.

    Note that it is safe to run the installer against an already installed
    instance of NetEpi Collection v0.90 (released in May 2005) or later,
    although it is STRONGLY recommended that a backup be performed first:
    a backup of the relevant Web cgi-bin and html directories as well as a
    verified "dump" of the database using one of the PostgreSQL dump tools
    (see the PostgreSQL documentation for details).

    The application should be shut down before running the installer
    (typically by stopping the web server). The installer will update any
    application libraries that have changed, rewrite the configuration,
    upgrade the schema if necessary, and attempt to correct any problems
    in form registration.  Existing data is generally left alone, except
    in the case where the installer detects an out of date schema.

    Direct access to the data collected is best done via an ODBC
    connection, using the PostgreSQL ODBC drivers available from the
    PostgreSQL Web site. A database user which has only read-only access
    to the database should probably be used for most ODBC connections.


ACCESSING YOUR INSTALLATION of NetEpi Collection
================================================

If running in FastCGI mode, you should restart the apache daemon (httpd) 
on your Web server, and access the user and admin apps at URLs similar to
(substitute the address of your Web server for "www.yourserver.org"):

    http://www.yourserver.org/cgi-bin/collection/app.py

If you are accessing NetEpi across the Internet, you should use SSL by
substituting https in the above URLs and configuring your web server to
support SSL. We recommend that you configure Apache to require SSL for all
interactions with NetEpi.

Note that if the default 'register' mode is used for the
user_registration_mode configuration option (see above), then the login page
of NetEpi Collection allows potential users to apply for a user account.
This new user application process is, by necessity, unauthenticated, and is
therefore potentially vulnerable to abuse by third parties who may waste
time and resources by submitting false account applications. To protect
against this, it is strongly recommended that if NetEpi is deployed on the
Internet, and if 'register' mode is used, then an additional layer of http
basic authentication is employed using a single username/password pair that
can be shared between all legitimate users (and emailed to new users to allow
them to apply for their accounts). Note that this is merely an additional
"first-order" layer of protection as an adjunct to per-user login names and
passwords, which should NOT be shared between users or emailed around. x.509
certificates installed in client browsers could also be used for this purpose.

The 'invite' and 'sponsor' modes for the user_registration_mode option
were introduced to avoid the need for such additional layers of password
protection and to reduce the likelihood of new account "phishing"
attempts by imposters.

The following directives can be added to your Apache configuration to
provide a more convenient URL to access the applications (the directory
paths may need to be changed to suit your configuration):

    <Directory /var/www/html/collection/>
        DirectoryIndex /cgi-bin/collection/menu.py
    </Directory>

This directive will result in a menu page being shown on access to

    http://www.yourserver.org/collection/


BACKUPS
=======

    The system administrator needs to consider how backups of the
    database are to be performed - we suggest use of the PostgreSQL
    pg_dump command to dump the database to a file which will then be
    backed up as you would normally back up files.  There is no need to
    shut down the database to do back-ups, provided that you use pg_dump,
    so these backups can be scheduled as cron jobs and the dump file
    copied to another machine etc. Ability to restore from the pg_dump
    files should be tested, regularly, of course.

    As of version 0.93 of NetEpi Collection, it is no longer necessary to 
    additionally backup the form definitions, as these are now stored in
    the database itself. However, it may be wise to store backups of 
    XML exports of the form definitions from time-to-time. These can be
    obtained via the form editor in the admin application.

    We do not recommend backing up the PostgreSQL data-files directly,
    as the format of these changes between PostgreSQL versions, and the
    database must be shut down for the duration of the dump to get a
    consistent representation of the database.

    After restoring a database dump (with pg_restore), the installer 
    should be run again to ensure that the forms are correctly registered,
    and that the application schema is up to date.


Stand-alone Notification Daemon
===============================

When the application is being served by multiple machines, a single
notification daemon should be shared by all the servers. Set the
notification_host configuration option to the name or IP address of the
server that runs the daemon, and start the daemon explicitly:

    casemgr/notification/daemon --listen <ip_addr> --port <port> --bg

NOTE - the notification daemon protocol is currently unauthenticated - anyone
who can connect to the port can generate spurious notification messages,
or kill the daemon. By default, the daemon only accepts connections from the
local machine. In environments with untrusted users, the notification daemon
should not be used in stand-alone mode at this time (set notification_port
to a null string: '' or leave notification_host set to the default 'local').

Client interactivity reporting
==============================

The application uses some client-side JavaScript to collection data on
the "interactivity" of the application - specifically, the time taken
from the submission of a request to the resulting page "on load" event
firing. This includes a round trip across the network, the application
run time, and the time taken for the browser to render the page. The
application run time is also recorded separately. This data is written
to the web error long on the NEXT interaction with the server. The client
reports look like:

    client report: start=1184734979 ip=127.0.0.1 server=0.056 client=0.411 page=tools

A tool, tools/client_report.py is supplied to extract these lines from
the error log and either write them to a CSV file, load them into a
NetEpi Analysis dataset, or plot them via MatPlotLib. For example,
to extract the reports in CSV format to stdout:

    python tools/client_report.py --csv /var/log/apache2/error.log*

To load the reports into a NetEpi Analysis dataset:

    python tools/client_report.py \
        --dsname=clientreports \
        --dslabel='NetEpi Collection client reports' \
        --dspath=SOOM_objects -v \
        /var/log/apache2/error.log*

To plot the reports, starting from the beginning of 2008, grouped by
application page, for the "collection" instance:

    python tools/client_report.py \
        --plot --start 2008-1-1 --groupby page --filter inst=collection \
        /var/log/apache2/error.log*

For more options, see the usage message:

    python tools/client_report.py --help


seed_db
=======

    NOTE: This tool has not been kept up to date, and it no longer works
          with current versions of NetEpi Collection.

    For test (NOT production) installations the tools/seed/seed_db script
    can be used to install some sample users and units. Note that the
    sample users all have random passwords - before they can be used,
    the administrator will need to set their password to a known string. 

    To load the sample data, as root (or the DBA user):

        sh tools/seed/seed_db <database_name>

    NOTE: The installer must now be run again to fully register the forms
    and case definitions added by seed_db (see the Installation section
    above). If you omit this step, application exceptions will occur when
    the user attempts to fill in a form - running the installer will fix this.

Linux systems. These should only be used by expert users who have a
comprehensive understanding of the script's functionality. Misuse *will*
corrupt your system installation. They are not necessary for routine
NetEpi use or installation.

===============================================================================

e-mail templates:

The "mail" directory contains the default templates for notification
e-mails generated by the system, formated as RFC822 messages. It is
possible (but not recommended) to change these templates for specific
circumstances, although care must be taken to maintain the correct format.

Variables available for substitution into the templates are formated as
{{variable_name}}, and vary from template to template but all include:

    Configuration variables
    {{time}}
    {{datetime}}
    {{date}}

Where the message concerns a user, additional variables are available:

    {{username}}
    {{fullname}}
    {{title}}
    {{agency}}
    {{phone_work}}
    {{phone_mobile}}
    {{email}}.

The templates are:

    exception_notify

        Sent to the configured exception_notify address when an error
        occurs in the application logic. Additional variables include
        the details of the {{exception}}.

    register_invite

        Sent to a prospective user when an user invites them to register
        to use the system. Additional variables include details of the
        registering user, a URL that takes the user to the registration
        page {{url}}, and the {{enable_key}}. In some contexts, it may be
        undesirable to include the URL of the application - the template
        can be edited to remove this.

    registration_notify

        Sent to the configured registration_notify address when a
        new user registers to use the system.  Additional variables
        include {{sponsor}}, and details of the registering user.

    too_many_attempts

        Sent to the configured registration_notify address when a
        user makes too many attempts to log in with an incorrect
        password. Additional variables include details of the user.

The sender for generated e-mails can be overridden by inserting a "From"
header as the first line in the template, for example:

    From: NetEpi Collection <netepi@your.domain>
    To: {{exception_notify}}
    Subject: [{{appname}}] Uncaught exception report ({{datetime}})

    {{exception}}

Other RFC822 headers, such as Reply-to: can be overridden in a similar way.
